# ToothAtlas: How to use our data to spatially map expressed genes
## About
Spatial mappings of gene expression at E14.5 was made using DistMap method ([Karaiskos et al., 2017](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6360/194)). Briefly, Existing immunohistochemistry (IHC), immuno-fluorescence (IF) and in situ hybridization (ISH) data for dental marker genes (in total 103 genes used in E14.5 spatial mapping) were quality-checked before further extracted from published documents for downstream digitalization. Digitalized spatial matrixes were drawn according to the specific expression pattern of those digitalized dental markers. Gene expression profile of each cell from scRNA-seq dataset was then processed and mapped to the virtual tooth. Specific localization of expressed genes could then be predicted.
